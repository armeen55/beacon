# Beacon Execution Plan — 2026-04-07

## Phase 2: Candidate Pruning + Evidence Tier Wiring — COMPLETE

Auto-resolved: 6 → 13 (+117%). Review candidates: ~196 → 98 (-50%).
See VERIFICATION_LOG.md for full before/after table.

## Phase 4: Page Evidence Foundations — COMPLETE

### What was done
1. Fixed domain mismatch: `rfritz.com` → `ritzbuilders.com` in evidence-tier.ts (bug: snapshot_verified could never be true)
2. Wired page registry: pages.json loaded into candidates.ts for evidence tier verification
3. Evidence tiers now reach "exact" — 14/85 changes, 77/200 candidates
4. Citation evidence index wired: page_to_topics lookup gives +12 bonus to content-matching candidates on cited pages
5. Evidence tier displayed in all UI MatchFactors callsites (review queue, attribution card, results)
6. Score-snapshot enhanced with page registry, citation evidence metrics

### Key findings
- 71/200 candidates (36%) have citation topic support
- 15 candidates target pages cited for the event's topic but have vague changelog descriptions (no topic match)
- These 15 represent the biggest near-term precision opportunity: better changelog quality would let them auto-resolve
- Citation bonus only applies to content-matching candidates to avoid disrupting triage

### Files changed
- `src/domains/pages/evidence-tier.ts` — configurable owned domain, default ritzbuilders.com
- `src/domains/attribution/candidates.ts` — page registry, citation topic index, citation bonus in adjustScore
- `src/components/display/match-factors.tsx` — evidence tier display with tier labels/colors
- `src/components/data/attribution-card.tsx` — pass evidence tier to MatchFactors
- `src/components/data/candidate-review.tsx` — pass evidence tier to MatchFactors (3 callsites)
- `src/app/(shell)/results/[id]/page.tsx` — pass evidence tier to MatchFactors
- `scripts/score-snapshot.ts` — page registry, citation evidence metrics

## Phase 5 — Change Impact Engine — COMPLETE (2026-04-09)

Shipped:
- `src/domains/attribution/change-impact.ts` — impact confidence (high/medium/low), direction (positive/negative/mixed/none), **why** explanation, **next action** per change
- Types: `ChangeImpact`, `ImpactConfidence`, `ImpactDirection`; `ChangeVerdict` includes `negative`
- `/changes` + `/changes/[id]` — operator-facing impact UI (summary strip, badges, "What to do" column, detail assessment block)
- Builds on existing `computeScorecard` — no persistence or attribution scoring changes

---

## Phase 6 — Measurement Honesty (URL + Decline) — COMPLETE (2026-04-09)

Shipped:
- **URL normalization** in `matchUrl` (`compute.ts`): uses `normalizePageUrl` + `canonicalizeOwnedUrl`. URL factor now produces `strong`/`partial`/`none` instead of always `unknown`.
- **Decline event detection** in `events.ts`: `visibility_lost` + `mention_decline`. `isNegativeEvent` helper exported.
- **Scorecard negative verdict**: all-negative-events + primary → `negative` verdict.
- **Impact Engine**: direction uses event type system; why explanation distinguishes negative events.
- **UI labels**: `/review` + `/changes/[id]` display new event types.

---

## Phase 7 — Today Decision Surface — COMPLETE (2026-04-09)

Shipped:
- Today page (`/`) now surfaces **top 5 change impact signals** from the Impact Engine directly on the operator landing page.
- `page.tsx` calls `enrichWithImpact`, sorts by verdict priority + confidence + score, filters out `too_early` / `pending` / zero-event rows.
- `TodayClient` renders "Change impact signals" section: verdict dot, asset name, confidence badge, next-action text, score, event count, link to detail.
- Validated/negative changes get colored card borders (green/red) for instant visual scan.

---

## Phase 8 — Recommendation Engine — COMPLETE (2026-04-09)

Shipped:
- **`src/domains/product/recommendation-engine.ts`** — synthesizes proven impact + structural patterns + playbook briefs into ranked, actionable recommendations. Three recommendation types:
  - **replicate**: Apply a proven change pattern to a page with the same structural gap (e.g., "Add FAQ+Schema to /roofing-boulder — proven by validated FAQ addition to /roofing-denver")
  - **strengthen**: Improve a weak changelog entry that has linked events but weak evidence (suggests specific topic/URL to add)
  - **investigate**: Flag changes with negative impact for regression review
- **Today page wiring**: `computeRecommendations` called in `page.tsx`, top 5 passed to `TodayClient`
- **"Next best move" upgrade**: When the top recommendation is high-confidence + replicate, it becomes the proactive "Next best move" — system shifts from reactive (fix/triage) to evidence-based
- **UI**: "Recommended moves" section on Today between impact signals and work queue; type-colored cards (green/yellow/red), confidence badge, evidence summary
- No persistence, no scoring changes, no new stores. Pure synthesis of existing data.

## Proposed next (pick one track)

### A — Changelog quality depth
- The 15 citation-supported + no-topic cases — inline edit UI, batch quality audit
- "Strengthen" recommendations now exist (Phase 8) but could be surfaced on `/changes/[id]` detail

### B — Recommendation depth
- Show recommendations on `/changes/[id]` detail page ("Based on this validated change, do X to these pages")
- Topic-similarity matching for cross-topic recommendations (e.g., "denver roofing" worked → suggest "boulder roofing")

### C — Persistence / infra (only when intentional)
- Items in `master_execution_plan.md` post-Phase 3E backlog

### D — Pattern confidence loop
- Track when recommendations are acted on (operator applies a recommended change → new changelog entry → attribution → pattern strengthens)
- Persisted recommendation outcomes

### E — Operator feedback on recommendations
- Accept/dismiss/defer per recommendation → feeds priority ranking

---

### Historical: remaining precision opportunities
- 15 citation-supported but no-topic candidates — changelog quality (partially addressed by Phase 8 "strengthen" recs)
- Page discovery (discover.ts) batch context could feed richer signals
- 1 opportunity in imported data → opportunity clustering mostly inactive
