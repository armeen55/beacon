# Beacon Verification Log

## 2026-04-07 — New Chat Takeover

### Phase 0: Safety Checkpoint
- Branch: `checkpoint/beacon-new-chat-reset-20260407-1900`
- Commit: `2e4ddb0` — 100 files, 5820 insertions, 2916 deletions
- Tag: `beacon-handoff-20260407-1900`
- Working branch: `work/attribution-precision-20260407`
- No secrets exposed, `.data` and `.env*` gitignored

### Phase 1: Repo Truth Audit
- **Baseline score-snapshot run**: 45 events, 202 candidates, 6 auto-resolved, 39 needs-review
- **Score range**: 35–95, mean 59.0
- **Critical finding**: 60% of candidates have topic=none — overgeneration from broad changes
- **Critical finding**: evidence tiers exist but are not wired into live candidate flow
- **Critical finding**: hasMeaningfulSignal too loose — single structural factor sufficient
- **Verified**: all prior-chat claims about attribution factor repair are real
- **Verified**: review queue is fully operational on imported data
- **False**: evidence tiers affect live scoring (they don't — evidenceMeta never passed)

### Phase 2: Candidate Pruning + Evidence Tier Wiring
- Status: COMPLETE
- Files changed:
  - `src/domains/attribution/candidates.ts` — pre-score pruning, evidence tier wiring, no-content score cap, hard negatives
  - `src/domains/attribution/compute.ts` — exported EVIDENCE_TIER_BONUS/CAP
  - `src/domains/attribution/triage.ts` — topic-cluster auto-resolve rule
  - `scripts/score-snapshot.ts` — enhanced reporting with triage breakdown

#### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Auto-resolved events | 6/45 | 13/45 | +117% |
| Needs-review events | 39 | 32 | -18% |
| Needs-review candidates | ~196 | 98 | -50% |
| Suppressed candidates | ~0 | 74 | new |
| Contributing candidates | ~0 | 15 | new |
| Max score | 95 | 85 | evidence cap |
| Mean score | 59.0 | 53.3 | content cap |
| Measurement leaks | yes | no | eliminated |
| Evidence tier in live scoring | no | yes | wired |

#### What the numbers mean
- Auto-resolve more than doubled: 13 events now have clear, topic-matching primaries
- Review workload halved: 98 candidates to review instead of ~196
- 74 candidates properly suppressed (not shown to operator)
- 15 candidates marked as contributing (useful context, not blocking)
- Non-topic candidates capped at 45 so they can't crowd out real matches
- Evidence tiers now flow into attribution — probable capped at 85, weak at 55

#### What remains after Phase 2
- 32 events still need review (genuinely ambiguous or no topic match)
- URL matching is 100% unknown (data gap, not logic gap)
- 0 opportunities in imported data → opportunity clustering inactive
- Evidence tier "exact" unreachable without page registry

### Build Verification
- `npx next build` passes clean
- TypeScript: no errors
- All pages compile and generate successfully
