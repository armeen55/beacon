# Beacon Verification Log

## 2026-04-07 — New Chat Takeover

### Phase 0: Safety Checkpoint
- Branch: `checkpoint/beacon-new-chat-reset-20260407-1900`
- Commit: `2e4ddb0` — 100 files, 5820 insertions, 2916 deletions
- Tag: `beacon-handoff-20260407-1900`
- Working branch: `work/attribution-precision-20260407`
- No secrets exposed, `.data` and `.env*` gitignored

### Phase 1: Repo Truth Audit
- **Baseline score-snapshot run**: 45 events, 202 candidates, 6 auto-resolved, 39 needs-review
- **Score range**: 35–95, mean 59.0
- **Critical finding**: 60% of candidates have topic=none — overgeneration from broad changes
- **Critical finding**: evidence tiers exist but are not wired into live candidate flow
- **Critical finding**: hasMeaningfulSignal too loose — single structural factor sufficient
- **Verified**: all prior-chat claims about attribution factor repair are real
- **Verified**: review queue is fully operational on imported data
- **False**: evidence tiers affect live scoring (they don't — evidenceMeta never passed)

### Phase 2: Candidate Pruning + Evidence Tier Wiring
- Status: COMPLETE
- Files changed:
  - `src/domains/attribution/candidates.ts` — pre-score pruning, evidence tier wiring, no-content score cap, hard negatives
  - `src/domains/attribution/compute.ts` — exported EVIDENCE_TIER_BONUS/CAP
  - `src/domains/attribution/triage.ts` — topic-cluster auto-resolve rule
  - `scripts/score-snapshot.ts` — enhanced reporting with triage breakdown

#### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Auto-resolved events | 6/45 | 13/45 | +117% |
| Needs-review events | 39 | 32 | -18% |
| Needs-review candidates | ~196 | 98 | -50% |
| Suppressed candidates | ~0 | 74 | new |
| Contributing candidates | ~0 | 15 | new |
| Max score | 95 | 85 | evidence cap |
| Mean score | 59.0 | 53.3 | content cap |
| Measurement leaks | yes | no | eliminated |
| Evidence tier in live scoring | no | yes | wired |

#### What the numbers mean
- Auto-resolve more than doubled: 13 events now have clear, topic-matching primaries
- Review workload halved: 98 candidates to review instead of ~196
- 74 candidates properly suppressed (not shown to operator)
- 15 candidates marked as contributing (useful context, not blocking)
- Non-topic candidates capped at 45 so they can't crowd out real matches
- Evidence tiers now flow into attribution — probable capped at 85, weak at 55

#### What remains after Phase 2
- 32 events still need review (genuinely ambiguous or no topic match)
- URL matching is 100% unknown (data gap, not logic gap)
- 0 opportunities in imported data → opportunity clustering inactive
- Evidence tier "exact" unreachable without page registry

### Build Verification (Phase 2)
- `npx next build` passes clean
- TypeScript: no errors
- All pages compile and generate successfully

## 2026-04-07 — Phase 4: Page Evidence Foundations

### What was implemented
1. **Domain fix**: `evidence-tier.ts` defaulted to `rfritz.com` — changed to `ritzbuilders.com` and made configurable
2. **Page registry wiring**: `candidates.ts` loads `pages.json` into `Map<url, PageEntity>` for `classifyEvidenceTier` snapshot_verified lookups
3. **Citation evidence integration**: `candidates.ts` loads `page_to_topics` from `citation-evidence-index.json` and applies +12 score bonus to content-matching candidates whose pages are cited for the event's topic
4. **Evidence tier UI**: `MatchFactors` component now renders evidence tier label with color across all 6 callsites
5. **Score-snapshot enhanced**: now uses page registry for tier distribution; reports citation support metrics

### Before/After Results

| Metric | Post-Phase-2 | Post-Phase-4 | Change |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Auto-resolved events | 13/45 | 13/45 | maintained |
| Needs-review events | 32 | 32 | maintained |
| Needs-review candidates | 98 | 77 | -21% |
| Suppressed candidates | 74 | 95 | +28% |
| Max score | 85 | 100 | evidence tier exact unlocked |
| Mean score | 53.3 | 58.7 | +10% |
| Evidence tier "exact" reachable | no | yes (14 changes, 77 candidates) | FIXED |
| Citation evidence in scoring | no | yes (71 candidates supported) | NEW |
| Evidence tier in UI | no | yes (all callsites) | NEW |

### New Diagnostics
- **Citation-supported candidates**: 71/200 (36%) — their pages are cited for the event's topic
- **Citation-supported + no-topic**: 15 candidates — pages cited but changelog descriptions too vague for topic match
- **Evidence tier distribution (changes)**: exact 16%, probable 46%, weak 38%
- **Evidence tier distribution (candidates)**: exact 39%, probable 37%, weak 25%
- **Pages in registry**: 5,297 (42 owned)
- **Citation page-topics entries**: 5,253

### What this means
- Evidence tiers are now fully operational in the live attribution flow
- The "exact" tier is achievable and correctly requires both structural URL and page registry match
- Citation evidence provides a new topic-adjacent signal without disrupting triage stability
- The 15 citation-supported but no-topic candidates identify the biggest near-term changelog quality opportunity
- Suppressed candidates increased from 74 to 95 due to better scoring separation

### Build Verification (Phase 4)
- `npx next build` passes clean
- TypeScript: no errors
- All pages compile and generate successfully
- `score-snapshot.ts` runs successfully with page registry and citation evidence
